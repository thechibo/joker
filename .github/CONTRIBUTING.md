Thank you for your interest in contributing to `joker`! Whether it’s reporting a bug or proposing a feature, your help is greatly appreciated.

# Lifecycle Statement

This package is in an initially stable state of development, with a great deal of active subsequent development envisioned.

## Reporting Bugs

If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).
See the tidyverse guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.

### Code style

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  

*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. 
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.
